					<p>LayerSlider WP is a premium multi-purpose slider for creating image galleries, content sliders, and mind-blowing slideshows with must-see effects, even from your WordPress posts and pages.</p>

					<p>It uses cutting edge technologies to provide the smoothest experience that's possible, and it comes with more than 200 preset 2D and 3D slide transitions. It has a beautiful and easy-to-use admin interface with supporting modern features like drag n'drop WYSIWYG slider builder, real-time previews, timeline view, Google Fonts and transition builder for custom animations.</p>

					<p>It's device friendly by supporting responsive mode, multiple layouts, touch gestures on mobile devices, and uses techniques like lazy load and conditional script loading for optimal performance.

				<!-- Installing / Updating: Installation -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="installation">Installation</h1>
					<h3 data-target="installation-file">Locate the install file</h3>
					<p>The main plugin package (that CodeCanyon offers to download by default) contains useful assets like the documentation, examples and source files. WordPress, however, expects a very specific install file. In order to provide you both the installable plugin and additional assets, we've bundled them together into one ZIP file. This is the reason why in most cases you will need to unpack the downloaded ZIP file first, then use the installable package inside.</p>
					<ol class="nomargin">
						<li>If you explicitly chose the <code>Installable WordPress file only</code> option when you've downloaded the plugin from CodeCanyon, then you have nothing to do. That is the file you will need to use during the installation.</li>
						<li>In any other cases, you will need to first unpack the ZIP file you've downloaded from CodeCanyon. The installable file will be inside, it's usually called something like <mark>"layersliderwp-x.x.x.installable.zip"</mark>.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 data-target="installation-wp">Installation through the WP admin interface</h3>
					<ol class="nomargin">
						<li>Locate the installable file described in the above section.</li>
                        <li>On your WordPress admin area navigate to <code>Plugins</code> -&gt; <code>Add new</code>, then press the <code>Upload Plugin</code> button on the top of the page.</li>
                        <li>Choose the installable ZIP file mentioned previously, then hit the <code>Install Now</code> button.</li>
                        <li>WordPress might ask you to enter your FTP login credentials. Click on <code>Proceed</code> when you've finished.</li>
                        <li>The plugin is now installed, click on the <code>Activate Plugin</code> button.</li>
                        <li>A new menu entry called <code>LayerSlider WP</code> should appear on your WordPress admin sidebar.</li>
					</ol>

					<div class="cf video-box">
						<a href="https://youtu.be/Y2rvCJxiHkA" target="_blank" class="video">
							<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y2rvCJxiHkA/mqdefault.jpg">
						</a>
						<h4>Check out our video tutorial!</h4>
						<p>If you're unsure where or how to install the plugin, <br> just watch our short screencast video.</p>
					</div>

					<h3 data-target="installation-ftp">Installation via FTP</h3>
					<ol class="nomargin">
						<li>Locate the installable ZIP file described at the top of this page, then unpack it.</li>
                        <li>Open your favorite FTP application and connect to your server. Navigate to the <mark>"/wp-content/plugins/"</mark> folder.</li>
                        <li>Copy over the <mark>"LayerSlider"</mark> folder extracted from the installable ZIP file.</li>
                        <li>Navigate to the <code>Plugins</code> page on your WordPress admin area and click the <code>Activate</code> button below LayerSlider WP.</li>
                        <li>A menu entry called <code>LayerSlider WP</code> should appear on your WordPress admin sidebar.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 data-target="installation-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Please be aware that you must use the <mark>"layersliderwp-x.x.x.installable.zip"</mark> file when you try to install the plugin from the WP admin area. The main package downloaded from CodeCanyon contains a lot of other assets. You must unpack it first, then find the above mentioned file inside for installation.</li>
						<li>If you receive a <code>No valid plugins were found</code> error message, you've almost certainly uploaded the wrong ZIP file. Please read the previous point and the installation instructions again.</li>
						<li>In some very rare cases, certain server settings (e.g. upload size limit, memory limit) could prevent you to install the plugin from your WordPress admin area. If you're experiencing any issue, please contact your server host and ask them to change the relevant settings. Alternatively, you can also revert to the FTP installation method, so you don't have to wait in the meantime.</li>
						<li>If you receive an error message that says <code>"Are you sure you want to do this?"</code>, it's most likely the same server configuration issue explained in the previous point. WordPress displays this as a generic type of error message, so there could be other reasons as well.</li>
						<li>Your web hosting service provider might offer other methods to install plugins such as web-based FTP clients or 3rd party solutions made explicitly for WordPress. Although these should be fine, it's possible that in some cases they might not work as expected and you will need to revert to one of the conventional methods.</li>
						<li>If you're experiencing any issue after installing LayerSlider, please try to temporarily disable other plugins and switch to one of the default WordPress themes to see if it helps. LayerSlider should play along nicely with any plugin/theme you use, but incompatibility issues could occur due to several other reasons.</li>
					</ul>
				</article>

				<!-- Installing / Updating: Activating the plugin -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="activation">Activating the plugin</h1>
					<h3 data-target="activation-intro">Why activating?</h3>
					<p>In addition to your purchase, you're entitled to the following exclusive features and services by activating your site with a purchase code:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Enjoy our priority support services to get help quickly and easily.</li>
						<li>Receive 1-Click plugin updates, including early access releases.</li>
						<li>Unlock premium features in the plugin providing new and interesting ways to extend the capabilities of your sliders.</li>
						<li>Import premium slider templates, which you can use as a starting point for your projects. We're releasing and updating premium content regularly.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 data-target="activation-bundles">I received LayerSlider bundled in my theme</h3>
					<p>We take plugin development very seriously and we're dedicated to offer the best product we can produce. Even if you're using a non-activated copy, it still has great features with almost unlimited capabilities to be a premium experience. Nevertheless, some additional features are only available for our direct buyers who have supported the plugin development by purchasing LayerSlider.</p>
					<p>If LayerSlider came bundled in your theme, please keep in mind that it is a bonus item that you essentially received for free. While we are providing a premium experience for everyone, it's important to know that we do not receive any share from theme sales. By offering some exclusive features we're encouraging users to support the development of future versions of LayerSlider.</p>
					<p>Theme bundles is a great way to increase our popularity by offering our unique and useful products to the crowd. However, product development and customer support require a lot of resources, thus we can only offer our services to users who have purchased LayerSlider.</p>


					<h3 data-target="activation-howto">How do I activate LayerSlider?</h3>
                    <p>You just need to enter your <a href="#activation-purchase-code">Item Purchase Code</a> received after purchasing LayerSlider into the <mark>PRODUCT ACTIVATION</mark> section and press the <mark>Activate Now</mark> button.</p>

					<figure>

						<figcaption>Illustration of the Product Activation section</figcaption>
					</figure>

                    <h3 data-target="activation-sites">Can I activate multiple sites?</h3>
                    <p>A purchase code can be used to activate 2 domains. One for your main site, and one for a local/development mirror. In line with the Envato's licensing terms, each site requires separate licenses with a unique purchase code. However, by deactivating your site, you can freely migrate your license to another server/domain if you're moving your site.</p>

					<h3 data-target="activation-purchase-code">Where is my Purchase Code?</h3>
					<p>You can find your Purchase Code in the email received upon the purchase. You can also download your license certificate from CodeCanyon at any time. Just navigate to your <a href="https://codecanyon.net/downloads?filter_by=codecanyon.net" target="_blank">Downloads page</a>, then find LayerSlider and choose the <mark>License certificate &amp; purchase code</mark> option from Download button. Your Purchase Code is inside the downloaded text file.</p>

						<figcaption class="zigzag">Your Purchase Code in the downloaded license certificate file</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h3 data-target="activation-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
					<ul>
					    <li>You can't use your theme's purchase code in case if you've received LayerSlider bundled in a theme. For more information, please read the <a href="#activation-bundles">Theme bundles</a> section above.</li>
						<li>Please double check that you've entered your purchase code correctly if product activation doesn't accept it. Verify that you haven't accidentally included spaces or other surrounding text and characters.</li>
						<li>Rarely, a temporary outage in our/Envato services could also result in unrecognized purchase codes. Please try it again a little later.</li>
						<li>In some edge cases, servers might be configured in a way that prevents your installation from connecting to our server. Usual symptoms include <code>An unexpected error occurred</code> error messages. It's worth asking your web hosting company about this if you've ruled out other possibilities. Also, check the <code>LayerSlider</code> -&gt; <code>System Status</code> menu on your WP admin sidebar to identify potential issues you might have on your site.</li>
					</ul>

				</article>

				<!-- Installing / Updating: Updating the plugin -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="updating">Updating the plugin</h1>
					<h3 data-target="updating-auto">Updating via Auto-Updates on activates sites</h3>
					<p>After activation, LayerSlider updates will automatically appear on your site in the same way as any other WordPress update. You can check if there is a new version available on the <code>Plugins</code> or <code>Dashboard</code> -&gt; <code>Updates</code> pages. A notification will also appear on the LayerSlider WP admin pages about new releases.</p>
					<p>To access early-access versions, select the beta release channel in the <mark>PRODUCT ACTIVATION</mark> box.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="assets/img/illustration-auto-updates@2x.png" alt="Purchase Code" >
						<figcaption>Illustration of Auto-Updates and site activation settings</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h3 data-target="updating-manual">Updating the plugin manually</h3>
					<p>Once you've downloaded the most recent version from your CodeCanyon downloads page you can deactivate and remove the old version, then install the new one. Your sliders and settings are in the database, removing the plugin won't touch them. You don't have to worry about losing your work, as keeping LayerSlider backward compatible is one of our top priorities, even for really old releases.</p>

					<h3>Updating the bundled version in themes</h3>
					<p>If you've received LayerSlider as a bundled item in your theme, new releases will be provided by the theme author through theme updates, since Auto-Updates won't work without activating your copy of LayerSlider. However, if you choose the purchase a license for LayerSlider, theme bundled versions can also be activated and updated without reinstalling the plugin.</p>

					<h3 data-target="updating-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
					<ul>
					    <li>Please note, WordPress checks for new updates periodically at certain times and caches the results. Even if there is a new version available, it might not appear immediately after activation.</li>
						<li>Keeping LayerSlider backwards compatible is one of our top priorities. However, there are times when major updates introduce new features and new settings, which depending on their defaults might alter your sliders a bit. If you experience any unwanted change, it's always a good idea to check the settings of your sliders, there are probably new options to control these changes.</li>

					<p>Premium slider templates are particularly useful as a starting point for your future projects. We're releasing and updating premium templates regularly. Our goal is to cover most use cases, whether you need a slider for personal use (such as slideshow for family photos), or you want to use it on your business website, or even on billboards. Our selection includes great examples for retail shops as well as templates for creative work.</p>

						<li>If you're experiencing any issue with importing, it's probably linked to memory or execution time limitation on your server. To fix these issues, please contact your web hosting company, since they usually don't offer a way to change these settings remotely.</li>

				<!-- Getting Started: Using Google Fonts -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="google-fonts">Using Google Fonts</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider can load custom fonts hosted by Google on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">fonts.google.com</a>. You can find the corresponding section on the plugin's admin page, see the illustration below. Custom fonts loaded with the editor will be automatically added to the pre-defined fonts you can choose from in the Slider Builder.</p>

					</figure>

					<h3>Character set support</h3>
					<p>By default, LayerSlider uses Latin characters for added Google Fonts. However, it supports Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Khmer and Vietnamese scripts as well.</p>

					<h3>Themes with Google Fonts support</h3>
					<p>Many WordPress themes support Google Fonts. However, it's common that they only load them on the front-end pages and they will appear incorrectly when you would build a slider on the admin interface. To workaround this issue just add them in LayerSlider and check the "Load only on admin interface" option. This way you can avoid loading the same font multiple times on the front-end pages.</p>

				<!-- Using the Slider Builder: Overview -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="builder-overview">Getting started with the slider builder</h1>
					<p>Since LayerSlider allows you building professional grade animated material, its slider builder interface can be a bit overwhelming at first. There are many options to control every aspect of your content. This is why it is important to take time and try to understand the basics with the following tips:</p>
					<ul>
					    <li><mark>Read the tooltips:</mark> Almost everything on the admin interface reveal further information with tooltips. Just move your mouse cursor over option fields, buttons, and other interface elements, and the exact description of those will appear in a tooltip message.</li>
					    <li><mark>Use the preview mode:</mark> By pressing the Preview button you can see your work in action instantly. Don't be shy to change settings. If you're not sure about how an option works exactly, just change it and observe the differences in the preview mode. When previewing a layer, you can change the content and settings on the fly, and see the changes instantly, without the need to jump in and out of preview every time something changes.</li>
					    <li><mark>Use slider templates:</mark> Discussed under <a href="#demo-sliders">Gettings Started / Importing slider templates</a>, you can see how we built our demo sliders and which settings we used to achieve certain animations. You can find both simple and complex sliders to discover LayerSlider's capabilities. Don't be afraid of making changes on these samples, you can always import a fresh copy at any time. Premium slider templates can also be the starting point of your projects since we're focusing on covering most use cases.</li>
					</ul>

				<!-- Using the Slider Builder: Slider settings -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="builder-slider-settings">Slider settings</h1>
					<p>This is the page where LayerSlider navigates you after adding a new slider. On this screen you can set common settings like the size of the slider, and customize its appearance or features in the other sub-sections.</p>
                    <p>We do not provide an extensive list of settings here since every option has its description displayed on the admin interface. Please review them carefully, so you can customize your slider behavior and appearance in the way you like. </p>

				<!-- Using the Slider Builder: Slide defaults -->
                <h2 data-target="builder-slide-defaults">Slide defaults</h2>
				<p>When you will work with slides and layer, you may notice that some option can inherit values from higher up the hierarchy. Layers can inherit option values from slides, and in the same manner, slides can inherit values from slider-wide global options. This gives you an opportunity to have a master switch to control certain settings. For example, instead of setting the sizing mode for each slide background one by one, you can just leave them on the value <code>inherit</code>, then set only one option in slider settings. We're using the inherit value by default for the options where it makes sense, so you don't have to bother with that. Just keep in mind that you can control some options from a central place.</p>
				<figure>

				<!-- Using the Slider Builder: Advanced Settings-->
				<h2 data-target="builder-advanced-settings">Advanced settings</h2>
				<p>The slider settings section contains hidden options which can be displayed separately. The main goal is to remove clutter from the user interface, since these options control overly specific features, or they meant to be used by experienced users. You can display these options with the switch on the upper right corner. See the illustration below.</p>

				<article>

					<h1 data-target="builder-slide-options">Adding slides</h1>
					<p>As mentioned previously, we don't have an extensive list of all the available options in this documentation, since the admin user interface contains all these information and you can access them on the fly. Just hover over an option/button with your mouse cursor, then a tooltip will appear describing the option in question.</p>
					<p>Please note, keeping space efficiency in mind we hide some options used less frequently. Just click on the <mark>SHOW MORE OPTIONS</mark> button, then you can reveal every slide option.</p>

					<h2 data-target="builder-slide-transitions">About slide transitions</h2>
					<p>LayerSlider offers more than 200 pre-defined 2D/3D slide transitions. By using the <a href="#transition-builder">Transition Builder</a> it can be easily extended with custom ones for your own needs. Slide transitions will only use the background image of slides since web standards don't offer a way to "capture" all contents within a slider. It's important to keep in mind that layers will not be used for slide transitions, even if they made to look like a background image.</p>
					<p>Modern web browsers are required for 3D transitions to work properly. If you select any 3D transition, LayerSlider will prioritize them over 2D ones. The plugin has multiple fall-back levels whenever a visitor's machine is not capable of showing certain transitions. In general, 2D transitions are supported on all major web browsers.</p>


					<h2 data-target="builder-slide-linking">Linking slides</h2>
					<p>Linking a slide will make its entire surface clickable. You can also link layers to add a button or a smaller control. Layers appear on top of slides and will gain priority if you link both a slide and one of its layers.</p>

                    <h3>Smart links</h3>
                    <p>Smart links can control the slideshow and slider navigation with pre-defined special links. Just enter one of the following to the linking field, then the linked content will automatically perform the corresponding action.</p>
                    <div class="table">

                        </table>
                    </div>

					<h3>Deeplink</h3>
					<p>You can use deeplinking to give a special URL to users, which will start your slider with a certain slide when they visit your site. To do that, you have to specify a <code>Deeplink</code> name in slide options and use it as a reference in the URL with a hashtag. For example, if you've entered the name "surprise", your URL should look like this: yourdomain.com/yourpage/#surprise. This will start LayerSlider with the slide where you set it (instead of the first one) when someone navigates to the page with this URL.</p>
					<div class="km-notification info cf">
                        <span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
				        It's important to note, that deeplinking only control the starting slide when someone arrives to your site. Use smart links described in the previous section to build a back and forth type of navigation between slides.

					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-devices">Device support</h2>
					<p>It's possible to build multiple layouts for different devices in the same slider by dynamically showing and hiding layers. With the <mark>Show this layer on the following devices</mark> buttons, you can choose on which devices should the currently selected layer appear.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="assets/img/illustration-layer-devices@2x.png" alt="">
						<figcaption >Choosing devices for layers to appear</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-media">Embedding videos</h2>
					<p>LayerSlider supports YouTube, Vimeo, and self-hosted HTLM5 video/audio out of the box. We've integrated many features for these solutions such as setting autoplay, preview image, volume and other controls. They will also automatically pause and resume the slideshow while playing.</p>
					<p>Just choose the <code>Video / Audio</code> layer type to embed multimedia contents. For YouTube and Vimeo videos you need to paste the embed code from their website into the text field. Otherwise, click on the <code>Add Media</code> button to add self-hosted HTML5 video or audio.</p>

					<p>To use HTML5 self-hosted video/audio, please make sure you're using supported media formats <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility" target="_blank">described here</a>. We recommend using <mark>MP3</mark> or <mark>AAC in MP4</mark> for audio, and <mark>VP8+Vorbis in WebM</mark> or <mark>H.264+MP3/AAC in MP4</mark> for video. The supported formats may vary between browsers, but you can also provide multiple formats if needed by holding down the Ctrl/Cmd key and selecting multiple items from your WordPress Media Library.</p>

					<p>At the moment we do not support other media players out of the box since those solutions have their own distinct APIs to control media playback. However, users with web development experience can use the <a href="#layerslider-api">LayerSlider API</a> to detect slider events and run custom code to control 3rd party media players.</p>

					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-shortcode">Using WP shortcodes and interactive content</h2>
					<p>Make sure you add WP shortcodes or other interactive content (such as Google Maps embeds, custom scripts, etc) to an <code>HTML</code> layer. Shortcodes will only be rendered on front-end pages, so don't be afraid if the slider builder interface doesn't show the result you would expect.</p>
					<p>Using interactive content highly relying on Javascript can be problematic, and might not work properly. Since we cannot workaround every possible issue in someone else's code, it's possible that some shortcodes and embed will be broken.</p>
					<p>It also worth mentioning that in responsive mode LayerSlider only scales the layer element itself to gain extra performance. The content inside should adapt the dimension changes on its own. While this happens automatically in most cases, shortcodes and complex HTML might not be resized in sync with the slider.</p>


					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-transitions">Layer transitions</h2>
					<p>This is where you can build your layer transitions. This section can be daunting at first since LayerSlider offers many options to customize every aspect of your work. However, everyone can learn it quickly and easily by following the tips already mentioned previously:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<mark>Read the tooltips:</mark>
							Almost everything on the admin interface reveal further information with tooltips. Just move your mouse cursor over option fields, buttons, and other interface elements, and the exact description of those will appear in a tooltip message.
						</li>
						<li>
							<mark>Use the preview mode:</mark>
							By pressing the Preview button you can see your work in action instantly. Don't be shy to change settings. If you're not sure about how an option works exactly, just change it and observe the differences in the preview mode. When previewing a layer, you can change the content and settings on the fly, and see the changes instantly, without the need to jump in and out of preview every time something changes.
						</li>
						<li>
							<mark>Use slider templates:</mark>
							Discussed under <a href="#demo-sliders">Getting Started / Importing slider templates</a>, you can see how we built our demo sliders and which settings we used to achieve certain animations. You can find both simple and complex sliders to discover LayerSlider's capabilities. Don't be afraid of making changes on these samples, you can always import a fresh copy at any time. Premium slider templates can also be the starting point of your projects since we're focusing on covering most use cases.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There are multiple types of animation, you can view one at the time by clicking on its title or icon. In each section, you can find the description of what it does and when it will be used. For clarity, we've made animated illustrations that you can see by hovering over the icons. The green highlight shows which transition types are being used by the layer, while the scaled (larger) icon shows the currently opened transition section.</p>

					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-linking">Linking layers</h2>
					<p>You can link a layer under its <code>Link &amp; Attributes</code> tab. Enter a URL and set whether you want to open it on the current page or in a new tab/window.

                    <p>Smart links are also available to control the slideshow and slider navigation with pre-defined special links. Just enter one of the following to the linking field, then the linked content will automatically perform the corresponding action.</p>
                    <div class="table">

                                    <td>Stops the slideshow, so the slider will not navigate away from the current slide.</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                                    <td>Jumps to the specified slide. Replace the <mark>{n}</mark> part with a slide number. For example, #3 will switch to the third slide. Please do not include spaces between the hash mark and your number.</td>

                    </div>

                    <h2 data-target="builder-layer-attributes">Layer attributes</h2>
					<p>You can also apply commonly used attributes (such as a unique ID or classes) on layers in the same section. These settings are made for users with web development experience who want to use custom coding to achieve a customization level that a visual editor cannot provide.</p>
					<p>Apart from the pre-defined list of attributes, it's also possible to add your own. In the custom attributes section, you can enter any attribute name, including pre-defined ones to override them. Many 3rd party plugin uses custom attributes, this section is important if for example you would like to <a href="#third-party-fancybox">set up a FancyBox image gallery</a> on LayerSlider layers.</p>


					<h2 data-target="builder-layer-styles">Layer Styles</h2>
					<p>Under the <code>Styles</code> tab of your layers, you can find commonly used formatting options to customize their appearance. We highly recommend using these settings whenever it's possible, instead of adding unnecessary HTML code to the contents of layers.</p>
					<p>This is where you can also set the position of layers with the <code>Left</code> and <code>Top</code> options. While you can use the visual editor to move layers around, it's often better to fine-tune them here for a pixel-perfect result.</p>

					<h1 data-target="builder-image-editor">Image editor</h1>
					<p>With the help of Adobe's Creative SDK, LayerSlider 6 now has a built-in image editor. You can perform common tasks like resizing, cropping, rotating images, as well as photo retouching, adding frames, text, effects, stickers and a lot more. It's like a mini-Photoshop.</p>
					<p>Look for the <img src="assets/img/adobe-cc-logo.jpg" class="adobe-cc-logo"> icon on the upper left corner of any image picker button to launch the editor with the currently selected image.</p>

				<article>
					<h1 data-target="builder-popout">Popout editor</h1>
					<p>One of the main design goals with LayerSlider 6 was the ability to work right in the preview area, without having to scroll up and down constantly to change settings. In addition to keyboard shortcuts, we've also added a <code><i class="dashicons dashicons-external"></i>Pop out editor</code> button, which will transform layer options into a floating window that can be resized and placed wherever you want. This makes it extremely easy to edit everything in one place.</p>

				<article>

					<h1 data-target="dynamic-layers">Dynamic layers from posts</h1>
					<figure>
						<img src="assets/img/illustration-dynamic-layer@2x.png">
						<figcaption class="zigzag">Illustration of dynamic layer settings</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>You can pull individual post information by using post placeholders. These are working very similarly to WordPress shortcodes. You can enter one or more placeholder into the layer's content area, then LayerSlider will automatically replace them with the appropriate content from posts. You can even mix them with static content. Example:</p>
					<p>
						This post was written by [author] on [date-published] will be<br>
						This post was written by admin on March 13, 2015
					</p>

					<h3>Using post filters</h3>
					<p>By using the post filters you can target certain WP posts or pages to pull information from. LayerSlider supports custom post types, tags, categories, and taxonimies to find literally any kind of custom content that themes and plugins may use. To set filters you just need select a dynamic layer and click on the <code>Configure post options</code> button. In the opened modal dialog window you can also order the results in your preferred way.</p>

					<h3>Get the items from results to work with</h3>
					<p>The post filters are global across slides, but you can select items from the results independently. This allows you to work with posts in a custom order, for example, you can retrieve only the even/odd posts from the results. If you want to follow the original order you can choose the option <code>following</code>, then LayerSlider will get them automatically.</p>

					<h3>Using mixed content</h3>
					<p>You are not forced to build sliders with dynamic contents only. You can mix them with static slides and layers.</p>

					<h3>Using custom post fields</h3>
					<p>You can use the <code>[meta:<i>fieldname</i>]</code> post placeholder to pull content from custom fields. Please make sure to replace the <mark>fieldname</mark> part with the actual field you want to pull information from.</p>

					<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I use static and dynamic contents at once?</strong>
							<p>A: Sure, you can mix them freely. Just make sure to select the <code>Dynamic content from posts</code> layer type.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I set custom [excerpt] for posts?</strong>
							<p>A: Yes, just enable the excerpt field under Screen Options when you're editing a post/page, then enter the desired content.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Q: How excerpts are generated?</strong>
							<ul class="nomargin" style="margin: 0;">
								<li>Manually entered excerpts will remain "as is", without any modification or formatting. Custom HTML code is allowed.</li>
								<li>Auto-generated excerpts have all shortcodes and HTML tags removed and they will appear as plain text.</li>
								<li>Auto-generated excerpts will be trimmed down to 55 words. The [...] "hellip" sign will be appended at the end if the text exceeds this limitation.</li>
								<li>Custom word count used by themes will be automatically applied in your sliders. Developers can override it by using filter hooks.</li>
								<li>Auto-generated excerpts respect WP's <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> tag, so you can easily split your content at the point you want.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>


						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I work with fixed posts?</strong>
							<p>A: No, the purpose of dynamic sliders is to automatically update their contents when you add a blog post or any other content on your site.

							<br><br>However, there is a simple workaround with a similar result. You can find specific posts with unique properties (e.g. custom tag) just by setting the right filters in the Post Options section of dynamic layers. The results will not update as long as you don't add more posts that match to the selected filters.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I use content from multiple posts on the same slide?</strong>
							<p>A: At the moment you can't. This feature is yet to be added in a later update.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Q: Can I pull content made by WooCommerce or other plugins?</strong>
							<p>A: Yes, see the "Using custom post fields" part.</p>

				<article>
					<h1 data-target="multilingual-sliders">Multilingual sliders</h1>
					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						Don't forget to disable the "Use slider markup caching" option under the Advanced tab on the main LayerSlider admin page. Due to technical difficulties, it's not possible to dynamically show up multilingual content in a cached copy. Your sliders could always show the same language string if you keep caching enabled.
					</div>

					<h2>How to translate the admin user interface?</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Download PoEdit</strong>
							<p>There are several apps available to help you with translating .PO files. PoEdit is a popular one, and it's available on every major platform. You can download it from <a href="http://www.poedit.net/download.php" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Start translating</strong>
							<p>Open the default LayerSlider-en_US.po file from your "/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/locales/" folder. When you save your work PoEdit will generate you a .MO file which will be needed to apply your work.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Name your files properly</strong>
							<p>WordPress recognizes your localization by a special formatting of file names. You will need to include the right <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Language-Codes" target="_blank">language</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Country-Codes" target="_blank">country</a> codes so it can identify what language your work is made for.</p>
							<p>For example, a French localization would have the file names: LayerSlider-fr_FR.po and LayerSlider-fr_FR.mo. You must follow this syntax, including the dash, underscore, and lower- or uppercase letters.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Apply your localization</strong>
							<p>Copy your newly created .PO and .MO files into the "/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/locales/" folder. WordPress should use them immediately if you named your files properly.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Creating multilingual sliders with qTranslate</h2>
					<p>qTranslate is the one of the easiest way to create multilingual sliders in LayerSlider. It is a free and simple plugin that supports a shortcode-like syntax to enter text in multiple languages, so it can display the proper one for your visitors. LayerSlider supports shortcodes and other special syntaxes within the contents of layers, so you can enter something like this to create a multilingual slider:</p>
					<p><code>[:en]English text[:de]German text</code></p>
					<p>The line above will output "English text" if the visitor selected English page and "German text" if the visitor selected German. You can read more about qTranslate on its WP.org <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/" target="_blank">plugin page</a>.</p>

					<h2>Translating with the WPML plugin</h2>
                    <p>You need the "Multilingual CMS" version of WPML with installed WPML String Translation add-on.</p>
                    <h4>Translating the plugin's user interface:</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Navigate to WPML -&gt; Theme and plugins localization</li>
						<li>Select Translate by WPML option in Select how to localize the theme section.</li>
						<li>In the newly appeared list of plugins, select LayerSlider and click the Scan selected plugins for strings button.</li>
						<li>Under WPML -&gt; String translation menu item, you can now see and edit the texts that LayerSlider uses.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Creating multilingual sliders:</h4>
					<p>LayerSlider registers translatable strings when you save your work. If you want to translate a previously created slider, you need to re-save it, even if you won't change anything. Once LayerSlider registered the translatable items, they will appear under the WPML -&gt; String translation menu item in your WP admin sidebar.</p>

					<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Your sliders might always show the same language string if you don't disable the "Use slider markup caching" option under the Advanced tab on the main LayerSlider admin page.</li>
					</ul>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: Via Shortcode -->
				<article data-target="publish-shortcode">
					<h1>Method 1: Using shortcodes</h1>
					<p>Shortcodes are special placeholders, which you can paste into the WordPress text editor when editing posts and pages. They will be automatically replaced with the appropriate content on your front-end pages. Shortcodes are one of the most commonly used methods of inserting contents to your site. A lot of other solutions (e.g. page builders in themes) can also accept LayerSlider shortcodes to add sliders to your pages.</p>

					<p>Each slider has a unique shortcode. You can hover over a slider in your list and click on the <i class="dashicons dashicons dashicons-arrow-down-alt2"></i> icon to reveal slider actions, then select the <code><i class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></i> Embed</code> option to see its shortcode. You can also find the shortcode of a slider at the bottom of the Slider Builder page next to the save button.</p>

					<p>We've also added a small utility to the WordPress text editor toolbar. It will pop up a modal window with your most recent sliders to choose from. Click any of them, and the corresponding shortcode will be inserted to the editor. See the illustration below.</p>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: Via Widgets -->
				<article data-target="publish-widgets">
					<h1>Method 2: Using the LayerSlider widget</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider supports widgets, so you can add sliders to your front-end pages just by a drag n' drop. To do that, navigate to the Appearance menu on your left sidebar and select "Widgets". Grab the LayerSlider WP widget and drop it into one of your widget areas.</p>

					<p>Please note that some themes may not support a widget area that you're looking for. In this case, you can create a new widget area by editing your theme files. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Widgetizing_Themes" target="_blank">Here</a> is the official documentation about widgetizing your theme. However, this requires web development knowledge and we don't recommend for users without experience.</p>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: Page Builders -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="publish-page-builders">Method 3: Page Builders, Visual Composer</h1>
					<p>Most page builders in themes support embedding LayerSlider sliders out of the box. Whether you're using a custom solution or a popular plugin like Visual Composer, there is likely a way to use them with LayerSlider.</p>
					<p>Either there is a dedicated module/block/widget for LayerSlider, or you can insert shortcodes in the same manner described in the first method.</p>
					<p>If you experience any issue, please review the available options your page builder offers. Since each solution differs in design and behavior, there is no universal guide to them. You can also consider just using more conventional methods like shortcodes and widgets described in method 1 and 2 respectively.</p>

				<!-- Publishing sliders: With PHP function -->
				<article data-target="publish-php">
					<h1>Method 4: PHP function</h1>
					<p>Because a slider can be an integral part of your site, you may want to insert it dynamically from the template files. There is a PHP function (with additional filtering options) to do just that. For example, you can call it from the header.php file of your theme and it will insert your slider into the corresponding area. By providing filters you can show it on certain pages only depending on your settings. Here is the function definition:</p>
					<div>
						<code>layerslider ( mixed $sliderID [, string $pages] )</code><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The <code>$sliderID</code> parameter can be found in the list of your sliders on the LayerSlider admin area. See the first table column.</li>
							<li>The <code>$pages</code> parameter is a comma separated list of WordPress pages either by their name or database ID. If you are unsure about your page names or IDs, look at their URL, it is the last component.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>There is a special page name called <code>homepage</code>, with you can filter LayerSlider WP to display the slider on your home page only. It also works if you set up a static custom page instead of the default post listing.</p>
					<p>The following examples are all valid. You can use any of these, you can even mix them for your own needs:</p>
					<pre name="code" class="brush: php; highlight:10">
						&lt;?php layerslider(1); ?&gt; // Displays the first slider on every page
						&lt;?php layerslider(1, 'homepage'); ?&gt; // Displays the first slider only on your home page
						&lt;?php layerslider(1, 'my-custom-post-title'); ?&gt; // Displays the first slider on a custom page by name
						&lt;?php layerslider(2, '1369'); ?&gt; // Displays the second slider on a custom page by ID
						&lt;?php layerslider('homefullwidth', 'category-name'); ?&gt; // Displays the slider with the slug 'homefullwidth' on ali/custom page by a category name
						&lt;?php layerslider(3, 'homepage,about-us,1234'); ?&gt; // Displays the third slider on multiple pages</pre>
					<p>When you want to insert a slider it is important to check its ID on the LayerSlider WP slider list page. When you remove some sliders, their IDs won't be re-indexed and the sequence may broke up. This is important to keep persistent your sliders preventing unwanted changes on the already inserted ones.</p>

				<h1>Third-Party Integration Guides</h1>
				<h2 data-target="third-party-fancybox">Using FancyBox in sliders</h2>
				<p>FancyBox and other Lightbox-like plugins in general can be used to display almost any type of content in a modal window. Images, galleries, videos, other websites, pdfs, you name it. In our example we're demonstrating how to embed Google Maps, but you can use the same method to add other embeddable web services as well.</p>

				<h3>Setting up a Google Maps modal</h3>
				<ol class="nomargin">
					<li>First, you need to install a FancyBox WordPress plugin. In our guide we used <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/" target="_blank">Easy FancyBox</a>.</li>
					<li>Make sure to review the Easy FancyBox plugin settings and enable to load videos and iframes.</li>
					<li>After setting up FancyBox, jump back to LayerSlider and select a layer in the editor that you want to use with FancyBox.</li>
					<li>Under the Link &amp; Attributes tab, enter the URL you want to display with Fancybox, then enter the <code>fancybox-iframe</code> into the <code>class</code> field in the custom attributes section.</li>
					<li>That's it, FancyBox should now appear when you click on the layer on your front-end pages.</li>
				</ol>
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/img/illustration-fancybox@2x.png">
					<figcaption class="zigzag">Example of setting up a Google Maps modal with the Easy FancyBox plugin in a LayerSlider slider</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h3>Other use cases</h3>
				<p>Of course, FancyBox offers a lot more. You can also make image galleries or embed YouTube videos for example. All of these can be done by applying the appropriate class name and other special attributes described in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/faq/" target="_blank">Easy Fancybox documentation</a>.</p>

				<p>For example, To group multiple layers into one gallery, enter the same <code>rel</code> name on all layers. It can be a custom identifier of your choosing. For example: <mark>flowers-gallery</mark>.</p>

				<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
				<p>If you experience any issue, please verify that you've installed and activated the Easy FancyBox plugin, and you've reviewed all of its settings to allow the functionally you're seeking. For example, if you want to embed web contents, you need to allow <mark>iframes</mark>.</p>

				<h1>More guides are coming soon</h1>
				<p>Based on requests and popular demand, we will continue to include more and more integration guides to use LayerSlider with your favorites.</p>

				<!-- Advanced Customization: Transition Builder -->
				<article>

					<h1 data-target="transition-builder">Using the Transition Builder</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider WP supports various types of slide transitions. The Transition Builder offers you an easy-to-use visual editor to create custom transitions for your own needs. Transitions created with the editor will automatically appear in the list of available transitions when you're editing a slider.</p>

					<h3>Tips &amp; tricks</h3>
					<p>We can recommend the same tips as we mentioned in the Slider Builder section:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Hover over an option field with your mouse cursor to reveal more information.</li>
						<li>Watch the preview. The best way to learn is to instantly see how each option affect the transition you're building. Just play with the settings and observe the differences to understand their role.</li>
						<li>We have sample transitions, too! They should be already added to the Transition Builder when you first visit the page. You can see the settings we've used to build these samples. You can also import any of the 200+ pre-defined 2D/3D transitions we're using in the plugin.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Building 3D transitions</h3>
					<p>3D transitions are made up with 3 animation steps to create more complex transitions with multiple actions. The "animation" step is required, but the "before animation" and "after animation" steps are optional. You can use them to do some preparation before the animation starts or restore back some settings after it is finished.</p>

					<p>To help you better understand what are these steps, here is a simple example:</p>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Before the animation starts, you may want to scale down columns</li>
						<li>Then rotate them to left</li>
						<li>Finally, you want them to scale up back</li>
					</ul>


					<p>If you want a really simple transition, you don't have to use all the steps. In this case, please make sure to untick the "Enabled" checkboxes for the corresponding steps.</p>
				</article>

				<!-- Advanced Customization: Skin Editor -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="skin-editor">About LayerSlider WP Skin Editor</h1>

					<p>The LayerSlider WP skin editor offers you a graphical way on your WP admin area to modify LayerSlider skins without the need to work with files on FTP. The Skin Editor automatically detects additional content, so you can customize skins from other sources as well.</p>

					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						Editing a skin requires some basic CSS knowledge, please do not attempt to modify a skin if you aren't familiar with CSS. Malformed or invalid CSS code can break your slider appearance.
					</div>

					<div class="km-notification warning">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-warning"></span>
						Please note, updating the plugin (including auto-updates) will override the plugin folder along with your modifications. Consider using the <a href="#css-editor">CSS Editor</a> or back-up your modifications before updating.
					</div>
				</article>

				<!-- Advanced Customization: CSS Editor -->
				<article>
					<h1 data-target="css-editor">About LayerSlider WP CSS Editor</h1>

					<p>With this editor, you can enter custom CSS code, which will be included on pages containing LayerSlider sliders. This gives you a chance for much more complex customizations that the Slider Builder interface cannot provide. Your CSS code will also be included in the Slider Builder, thus the Preview mode should pick them up and show the appropriate result on-the-fly.</p>

					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						Using CSS requires some web development experience. Please do not attempt to use this editor if you're not familiar with CSS. Malformed or invalid CSS code can break the appearance of sliders or your site.
					</div>
				</article>


				<!-- Advanced Customization: LayerSlider API -->
				<article>

					<h1 data-target="layerslider-api">About LayerSlider API</h1>
					<p>LayerSlider is built on standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and offers a way to extend the capabilities of the plugin through the LayerSlider API. Please note, this requires programming skills and web development experience, thus we cannot recommend it to users without the necessary knowledge.</p>

					<div class="km-notification info cf">
						<span class="dashicons dashicons-info"></span>
						LayerSlider 6 introduced a whole new API model with new events and methods. To view the API documentation for older releases, please navigate to the <a href="#legacy-api">Legacy API</a> section. The legacy API cannot be used in LayerSlider 6, it is documented only to provide you a way of porting (if needed).
					</div>

					<h2 data-target="api-events">Event reference</h2>
					<p>Event callbacks is a way to receive notifications and run custom code when certain actions occur in sliders. The following events can be used under the <code>Event Callbacks</code> tab of the Slider Builder.</p>

					<h2 data-target="api-event-data">Event Data object</h2>
					<p>Every event handler function will have the same 2 variables passed. These are the jQuery Event object and our custom slider data object. You can name these variables by your choice, but we will refer to them as <code>event</code> and <code>slider</code> in our examples.</p>

					<p>Every <code>slider</code> data object will  contain the same properties, regardless of the used event. However, it's possible that some values are not yet set depending on the current point of execution. The data object contains the most relevant information, but we've also included the entire LayerSlider instance data source, which you can use to access or modify properties on the fly, as well as to add new methods to implement new features.</p>

					<p>We encourage everyone to use the browser developer tools and examine the returned data by using console.log() to see potentially undocumented data. Here is an example that you can paste into your browser's JavaScript console. Please make sure to use the right selection when targeting the slider container element on which the LayerSlider instance was created.</p>

					<h2 data-target="api-methods">API methods</h2>
					<p>The below API methods can be used to control sliders externally, modify their behavior, or wire them up with 3rd party solutions. By using the right combinations of API events and commands, you can implement new features or extended the capabilities of the plugin with custom code. Please note, API events are exposed to the API commands  in the same way as anything else. Be aware that most API methods will trigger the appropriate API events as well.</p>

				<h1 data-target="troubleshooting-reporting">Before reporting an issue</h1>
				<p>There are some common practices you should try before reporting an issue:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Check System Status</strong><br>
						Select <code>LayerSlider -&gt; System Status</code> on your WP admin sidebar. The page displayed is intended to help you identifying common issues and to display relevant debug information about your site. Always try the recommendations provided by this menu (if any) before reporting an issue.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Always use the latest software versions!</strong><br> This includes your WordPress installation, LayerSlider, the WP theme you're using and any other plugin installed on your site. Third party plugins and themes (not hosted on wordpress.org) may not update automatically. Taking care to keep everything up-to-date can spare you from a lot of problems and frustration.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find the source of the problem!</strong><br> Issues could be related to other plugins/themes and their settings. We often ask our customers to temporarily disable other plugins and switch to one of the default WP themes. This way we can verify that the issue is related to LayerSlider, and is not an incompatibility with another item. If it solves the problem, you can find which item caused the trouble by re-enabling them one-by-one and watching when the issue comes back.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find a solution!</strong><br> A lot of times issues occur due to incorrect settings or other environmental factors. It's always a good idea to quickly review your settings and try to find a solution in the documentation or online by searching through our <a href="https://support.kreaturamedia.com/faq/4/layerslider-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">FAQs</a>, the <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin-/1362246/comments" target="_blank">comments section</a> and the guides below.</li>

									With these symptoms, it's highly likely that there is a PHP error on your site.

Please <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress#WP_DEBUG" target="_blank">follow this guide</a> to enable the WP debug mode to make error messages visible.

									<br><br>
									Also, make sure that your web server meets the plugin requirements: PHP 5.3 or newer, PHP Multibyte String Extension, WordPress 3.5 or newer.
									Contact with your web hosting company to make the necessary changes if it's required.

									<strong>Quick Fix:</strong> Try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssl-insecure-content-fixer/" target="_blank">SSL Insecure Content Fixer</a> plugin, it should help in most cases.
									<br><br>

									Any part of your site can be responsible for HTTPS mixed / insecure content issues. To have a better understanding about what causing this issue, please read and follow the guide provided by Google on this matter by <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/fixing-mixed-content?hl=en" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.

									Navigate to <code>Settings -> General</code> on your WP admin area and verify that both the <mark>WordPress Address</mark> and <mark>Site Address</mark> fields are containing the right URL with the https protocol included.
									<br><br>

									Please note, as <a href="https://snippets.webaware.com.au/snippets/wordpress-is_ssl-doesnt-work-behind-some-load-balancers/" target="_blank">this post</a> mentions, load balancers, proxies, and other network-related solutions and services may cause WordPress to not recognize the correct protocol. LayerSlider uses native WP functions to generate URLs, thus in many cases it is a site/server-related issue that can easily affect other assets on your site.

					<h1>What's new in LayerSlider 6?</h1>

					<h4>Changes in version 6.0.1 – 6.0.5</h4>
					<ul class="nomargin">
						<li>Improved stability and compatibility with older versions of LayerSlider.</li>
						<li>Fixed known issues introduced in LayerSlider 6.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Faster, Better, Prettier</h3>
					<p>Both the admin interface and front-end sliders load faster and perform better. This release has numerous bug fixes and improvements. So much actually, that we can't even write a complete list. The admin interface has also been redesigned a bit to provide familiar but much cleaner and easier controls.</p>

					<h3>Reworked Responsive Mode, New Slider Layouts, Device Dependent Layouts</h3>
					<p>The new responsive mode performs significantly better and in most cases it does not require any special configuration. LayerSlider now also have multiple new layout modes like full size, hero screne and full screen sliders. These will allow new use cases such as running slideshows on billboards. It's also possible to make different layouts for different devices (phones, tables, desktop).</p>

					<h3>New Transitions, Text Animations, Loop, Hover, Filters and a lot more</h3>
					<p>We've added lots of new transition options, which greatly extends the capabilities of your slideshows. You can now create chainable multi-step animations enhanced with stylish text transitions and interactive hover animations. There's also hidden surprises like the much requested Ken Burns effect, 3D parallax effect, and our new "play by scroll" feature. Oh, and don't forget to try out filters, which can be used to apply blur, sepia, grayscale etc. effects to your layers among many other.</p>

					<h3>Static Layers</h3>
					<p>Layers can now enter and leave on any slide. You can easily build more complex animations where layers persist across multiple slides. Or just use it as an "always on top" feature.</p>

					<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
					<p>Web apps usually don't have controls to undo unwanted/accidental changes. LayerSlider now has. And it's even preserved for later use, whenever you need it.</p>

					<h3>Multi-selection, Resize, Rulers + Guides</h3>
					<p>Do you ever wanted to move around multiple layers and once? LayerSlider 6 now supports multiple selection, which allows you altering groups of layers seamlessly. With rulers and keyboard shortcuts, you can now move/resize/etc your layers with precision. There's also Guides and a snap to feature built in.</p>

					<h3>Keyboard shortcuts &amp; Popout Editor</h3>
					<p>The slider builder interface can now be controlled by keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts also introduces a lot of new features, like editing layers content right in the preview area or copying and pasting layers across slides and sliders. We've also introduced the Popout Editor, which transforms the layer options area into a floating window that can be resized and placed wherever you want. This makes it extremely easy to edit everything in one place, without the need to scroll up and down constantly.</p>

					<h3>Image Editor</h3>
					<p>With the help of Adobe's Creative SDK, LayerSlider 6 now has a built-in image editor. You can perform common tasks like resizing, cropping, rotating images, as well as photo retouching, adding frames, text, effects, stickers and a lot more. It's like a mini-Photoshop.</p>

					<h3>And a lot more ...</h3>
					<p>There's way more new features and improvement that we can list here: scheduled sliders, retina-ready, serving dynamically scaled images to reduce data usage and speed up page loads on mobile devices, redesigned transition builder with import feature, continuous live previews, new interactive timeline, reworked multimedia layer support with custom video poster and controls, custom HTML attributes, drag 'n' drop image upload, smart links, copy &amp; paste layer styles and transition settings, named slides, new slider/slide background settings, auto-fit zoom, align layers feature. </p>
					<p>The number of new features almost never end, but this list must. :)</p>

					<h3>The future of LayerSlider</h3>
					<p>LayerSlider 6 is just the beginning of our awesome new ideas. One of the main goals was to completely rebuild the plugin architecture and modernize its core. This allows us to implement new features way more faster and improve upon existing functionality with an easily maintainable code base. Beyond the predictable feature updates like the complete overhaul of skins, dynamic contents, etc (which will arrive very soon); we already have an experimental offline slider editor and preliminary support for LayerSlider extensions. This later one will soon be available for anyone to extend the plugins capabilities.</p>

					<h3>Changes in version 5.6.0</h3>
					<ul>
						 <li>
						 	<strong>Huge performance boost:</strong>
						 	<p>Our Slider Builder interface loads and works drastically faster, while it uses considerably less resources on both the server and client-side. The amount of content you add to sliders no longer has an impact on performance, the editor should always be fast and responsive. This also fixes the memory limit and execution time issues on servers with limited resources.</p>
						 </li>
						 <li>
						 	<strong> Caching slider markup:</strong>
						 	<p>LayerSlider now uses its own caching mechanism to spare your server from unnecessary load. Most installations support memory caching, which provides instant access to your sliders based on visiting frequency. This means that a slider on your front-page could stay in memory for improved speed, but another one in a sub-page might fall back to regular disk cache to free up resources for the content matters the most.</p>
						 </li>
						 <li>
						 	<strong>Minor interface changes:</strong>
						 	<p>We made a minor interface change in the list of layers, which you hopefully find familiar. Hiding/locking layers now has a permanent effect. The layer settings section has been placed closer to the preview, so you need to scroll less.</p>
						 </li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>New features:</strong>

						<li>
							<strong>Other changes:</strong>

								<li>Updated GreenSock library for improved animation performance (especially on mobile)</li>
								<li>Removed old media uploader support (pre-WP 3.5)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Fixed issues:</strong>

				<h1>Support</h1>

				<h2 data-target="support-reporting">Before reporting an issue</h2>
				<p>There are some common practices you should try before reporting an issue:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Check System Status</strong><br>
						Select <code>LayerSlider -&gt; System Status</code> on your WP admin sidebar. The page displayed is intended to help you identifying common issues and to display relevant debug information about your site. Always try the recommendations provided by this menu (if any) before reporting an issue.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Always use the latest software versions!</strong><br> This includes your WordPress installation, LayerSlider, the WP theme you're using and any other plugin installed on your site. Third party plugins and themes (not hosted on wordpress.org) may not update automatically. Taking care to keep everything up-to-date can spare you from a lot of problems and frustration.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find the source of the problem!</strong><br> Issues could be related to other plugins/themes and their settings. We often ask our customers to temporarily disable other plugins and switch to one of the default WP themes. This way we can verify that the issue is related to LayerSlider, and is not an incompatibility with another item. If it solves the problem, you can find which item caused the trouble by re-enabling them one-by-one and watching when the issue comes back.</li>
					<li><strong>Try to find a solution!</strong><br> A lot of times issues occur due to incorrect settings or other environmental factors. It's always a good idea to quickly review your settings and try to find a solution in the documentation or online by searching through our <a href="https://support.kreaturamedia.com/faq/4/layerslider-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">FAQs</a> and the <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin-/1362246/comments" target="_blank">comments section</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 data-target="support-contact-us">How to contact us</h2>
				<p>
					If you didn't find an answer to your problem, please ask your question on <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin-/1362246/comments?ref=kreatura" target="_blank">the item discussion page</a> or send us a private message from our <a href="http://codecanyon.net/user/kreatura?ref=kreatura" target="_blank">Codecanyon profile page</a> (See the "Email kreatura" box on the right sidebar) - in this case we will reply via email. <strong>We can answer your support questions only in these ways, please do not email us directly.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
					IMPORTANT!</strong> For fast troubleshooting, please send us detailed information about the issue you're experiencing. Also <strong>send us your site URL</strong> whenever it's possible, so we can check your slider for potential issues and quickly suggest a solution. Please note, that we cannot troubleshoot from screencast videos or screenshots.
				</p>
				<p>Please be patient as it takes some time until we respond (usually in 24 - 48 hours).</p>
